# SOLO: Segmenting Objects by Locations

This project implements the SOLO (Segmenting Objects by Locations) algorithm for instance segmentation.

## File Descriptions

### solo_head.py

**Usage:** This file defines the SOLO model.

**Goal:** The main purpose of this file is to implement the SOLO head, which is responsible for predicting instance masks and categories. It includes the SOLOHead class, which processes feature maps to generate instance segmentation results.

### solo_arc.py

**Usage:** This file contains the overall SOLO network architecture.

**Goal:** The goal of this file is to define the complete SOLO network structure, including the backbone, neck, and head components.

### dataset.py

**Usage:** This file is used for handling dataset operations.

**Goal:** The main purpose of this file is to load, preprocess, and manage the dataset used for training and evaluating the SOLO model. It includes functions for data augmentation, batch generation, and other dataset-related utilities.

## Getting Started

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Prepare your dataset according to the dataset.py
4. Use solo_arc.py to train or run inference with the SOLO model
5. See notebook for usage and visualization
